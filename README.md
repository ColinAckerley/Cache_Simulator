# Cache_Simulator
A simple cache simulator for CS 211
This project was for Fall 2017 with Professor Santosh Nagarakatte 
This code is for reference only, do not copy this code or use it for your assignment
LRU was not implemented properly, but the eviction policy still works for direct mapped caches
Some of the code is choppy and poorly implemented but I did not have the time to change it
